# Welcome

Great! We love to see contributions. If you have something major, you may want to discuss this first.

# How

1. Use the GitHub web UI to create your own fork.
2. Clone that fork locally.
3. Create a new branch in that fork, and make the change.
4. Push branch and changes to your fork on github.
5. Go to the GitHub web UI for your repository. It will tell you that
   you can create a pull request. You click that and fill in the details,
   and then the elm-mdc maintainers will see it.

That's all!

Branch names are ephemeral. There are no conventions for branch names,
any name will do.
