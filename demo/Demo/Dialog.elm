                    Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies,

                    the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to
                    build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were
                    four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and
                    this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard
                    for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the
                    beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner,
                    and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no
                    garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in
                    the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could
                    go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty
                    enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by
                    a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder
                    led down into the small, dark hole.

                    When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she

                    Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat
                    country that reached to the edge of the sky in all
                    directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray

                    was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long
                    blades until they were the same gray color to be seen
                    everywhere.  Once the house had been painted, but the sun

                    the house was as dull and gray as everything else.
