{-| The Ripple component adds a material "ink ripple" interaction effect to
HTML elements.

The ripple comes in `bounded` and `unbounded` variants. The first works well
for surfaces, the other works well for icons.

The view functions `unbounded` and `bounded` return a record with fields

  - `interactionHandler` that has to be added to the HTML element that should be
    interacted with,
  - `properties` that applies the ripple effect to the HTML element. This is
    usually the same as the one `interactionHandler` is applied to, and

# Example


## Bounded Ripple effect

    import Html exposing (text)
    import Material.Options as Options exposing (styled)
    import Material.Ripple as Ripple


    let
        { interactionHandler
        , properties
        } =
            Ripple.bounded Mdc "my-ripple" model.mdc
    in
    Options.styled Html.div
        [ interactionHandler
        , properties
        ]
        [ text "Interact with me!"
        ]


## Unbounded Ripple effect

    let
        { interactionHandler, properties } =
            Ripple.unbounded Mdc "my-ripple" model.mdc
    in
    Icon.view
        [ interactionHandler
        , properties
        ]
        "favorite"
