The Ripple component adds a material "ink ripple" interaction effect to
HTML elements.

The ripple comes in `bounded` and `unbounded` variants. The first works well
for surfaces, the other works well for icons.

The view functions `unbounded` and `bounded` return a record with fields

- `interactionHandler` that has to be added to the HTML element that should be
  interacted with,
- `properties` that applies the ripple effect to the HTML element. This is
  usually the same as the one `interactionHandler` is applied to, and
- `style` which is a HTML `<style>` element which has to be added to the DOM.
  It is recommended to make this a child of the element that is interacted
  with.

# Example

## Bounded Ripple effect

```elm
import Html exposing (text)
import Material.Options as Options exposing (styled)
import Material.Ripple as Ripple


let
    { interactionHandler
    , properties
    , style
    } =
        Ripple.bounded Mdc "my-ripple" model.mdc
in
Options.styled Html.div
    [ interactionHandler
    , properties
    ]
    [ text "Interact with me!"
    , style
    ]
```


## Unbounded Ripple effect

```elm
let
    { interactionHandler
    , properties
    , style
    } =
        Ripple.unbounded Mdc "my-ripple" model.mdc
in
Icon.view
    [ interactionHandler
    , properties
    ]
    "favorite"
```
